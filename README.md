# CozyTodoApp
## 1. Introduction

Our project, CozyTodo Gaming Web Application, combines the concepts of task management and gamification into a unique platform. The CozyTodo app allows users to log in, manage their to-do tasks, listen to ambient music while working, and experience a gamified "round progression" system where completing tasks moves the user to the next game level.
This project was hosted on Glitch, utilizing a full-stack JavaScript environment (Node.js, Express.js) and explored the use of web-compatible game engines.

### Test Credentials for Evaluation:

Our application's email verification process is integrated with a **private MailTrap sandbox**, which is tied to our team's specific MailTrap account credentials.

Because of this, external users will not be able to independently verify new registrations outside of our sandbox environment.

**To enable smooth testing, we are providing two pre-verified user accounts:**

| User Type | Email | Password |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Admin Account |parushapradhan78new |parusha123new  |
| Regular User Account | parushapradhan |  parusha123|

**Details:**
- The **Admin account** has extended privileges, including access to the Admin Dashboard to view users, update levels, reset passwords, and reset sound settings.
- The **Regular User account** has standard user access: creating to-do tasks, using the timer, adjusting background music settings, and progressing through game rounds.

**Important Notes:**
- Attempting to register a new account will send a verification email to our private MailTrap inbox. Since this inbox is not publicly accessible, new accounts cannot complete verification externally.
- Therefore, we recommend testers use the provided credentials to fully explore the application features.
- If necessary, we can assist by manually verifying additional test accounts from our side.
